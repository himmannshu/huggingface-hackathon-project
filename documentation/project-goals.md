# Project Documentation

## Project Information

### Overview
This project creates an intelligent AI agent that automates video content processing and thumbnail generation for YouTube content creators. The system takes uploaded videos and generates optimized titles, descriptions, and multiple thumbnail options using advanced AI models.

### Goal
To develop an automated content enhancement pipeline that helps content creators optimize their YouTube videos by:
- Extracting and processing video content automatically
- Generating engaging titles and descriptions
- Creating multiple thumbnail variations with different styles
- Leveraging AI to enhance discoverability and engagement

## Workflow Process

### Step 1: Video Upload & Server Processing
- **Input**: User uploads a video file through Gradio interface
- **Architecture**: Server-side processing using Modal cloud infrastructure
- **Process**: Complete video file is uploaded to Modal container
- **Optimization**: Immediate processing pipeline initiation upon upload completion
- **Storage**: Temporary storage on Modal for processing duration only

### Step 2: Audio Extraction (Modal + FFmpeg)
- **Tool**: FFmpeg running in Modal container environment
- **Process**: Video file → FFmpeg audio extraction → Optimized audio format
- **Output Format**: WAV/MP3 optimized for Whisper model processing
- **Optimization**: 
  - Original video file deleted immediately after audio extraction
  - Audio file compressed for efficient Whisper processing
- **Benefits**: Reduces storage requirements and focuses processing on audio content only

### Step 3: Audio Transcription (Modal + Whisper)
- **Model**: OpenAI Whisper (open source) pre-loaded in Modal container
- **Architecture**: Dedicated Modal function for Whisper inference
- **Process**: Extracted audio → Whisper model → Speech-to-text conversion
- **Features**:
  - High-accuracy transcription with timestamp data
  - Optimized for fast inference with pre-loaded model weights
  - Automatic language detection and processing
- **Output**: Complete transcription of video content with timing information

### Step 4: Content Analysis & Search Term Generation
- **Agent Function**: AI agent creates search terms for YouTube content extraction
- **Process**: Analyzes transcribed content to generate relevant search queries
- **Additional Output**: Generates initial video description based on content

### Step 5: Content Enhancement
- **Process**: YouTube content is used as additional context
- **Purpose**: Combines video summary with external content research
- **Output**: Enhanced title and description generation using expanded context

### Step 6: Thumbnail Generation
- **Process**: All collected context is used to generate 3 different thumbnails
- **Feature**: Uses pretrained thumbnail styles for variety
- **Output**: Multiple thumbnail options with different visual approaches
